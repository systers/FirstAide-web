# FirstAide-Web [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/systers/FirstAide-web.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/systers/FirstAide-web)

### Abstract
Sexual assault and rape are serious social and public health issues, being one of the major cause of concern.
FirstAide-Web is a web based application developed to help the PCV (Peace Corps Volunteers), in case of sexual
harassment. The app ensures safety by sending messages to fellow volunteers, helpline numbers etc. when in trouble. This application makes it a point that the victim can be sure of getting all the help
he/she needs in case of a critical situation. The sexually assaulted volunteer can get information of Peace Corps policy and safety procedures and also contact Peace Corps for help.
