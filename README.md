# FirstAide-Web

Sexual assault and rape are serious social and public health issues, being one of the major cause of concern.
FirstAide-Web is a web based application developed to help the PCV(Peace Corps Volunteers), in case of sexual
harassment. National surveys by the United Nations estimate that one in every six women has experienced an attempt to
rape at some time or the other. The vast majority of women are sexually assaulted by men with whom they are acquainted.
Women are far less likely to report a rape or assault when they know their assailant, thus instance of sexual assaults
are greatly under-reported. The FirstAide web app ensures safety by sending messages to fellow volunteers, helpline
numbers etc. when in trouble. This application makes it a point that the victim can be sure of getting all the help
he/she needs in case of a critical situation. The sexually assaulted volunteer can get information of Peace Corps policy
and safety procedures and also contact Peace Corps for help.
