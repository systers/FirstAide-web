<p class ="fs17">The Peace Corps is committed to maintaining high standards of conduct in the workplace and providing all employees, Volunteers, and trainees a work environment that is free from harassment of any kind.  The Office of Civil Rights and Diversity, or OCRD, handles claims of harassment, including sexual harassment of a Volunteer or Trainee by a Peace Corps staff member or fellow Volunteer/ Trainee.</p>
<p class ="fs17">Sexual Harassment: Unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature.  Sexual harassment is behavior that is unwelcome, offensive, can cause fear or anxiety and can impact job performance.</p>
<p class ="fs17">The actions you may think are within tolerable ranges of acceptability may be offensive to others. People have different thresholds of tolerance for many of these behaviors. The bottom line is that ‘unwelcomed’ is determined by the recipient, not the person displaying the offensive conduct.</p>
<p class ="fs17">If you feel you are being sexually harassed, sharing this with either a Volunteer or staff  will better ensure that you get the help and support you deserve.</p>
<p class ="fs17">Cases of sexual harassment committed by a PCV or Peace Corps Staff member against a PCV can be reported to the Office of Civil Rights and Diversity (OCRD)</p>
