<p>All PCVs will deal with some type of unwanted attention at some point in their service. This occurs across all cultures. The reaction someone has in response is highly personal and depends on the type of unwanted attention. Reactions may range from a slight feeling of discomfort to anger to fearing for one’s safety.  You do not have to “be nice” if you feel unsafe or even uncomfortable.  Peace Corps staff are here to help and have been trained on how to help PCVs cope. It’s important to report unwanted attention that is severe in nature so you can get the help and support you deserve. </p>

<p>There’s a difference between unwanted attention and stalking. Stalking and cyber-stalking are defined as repeated threatening behavior from a single person that causes a Volunteer to fear for his or her safety or suffer substantial emotional distress. Unwanted physical contact, such as grabbing or touching, is considered assault, not unwanted attention.</p>
