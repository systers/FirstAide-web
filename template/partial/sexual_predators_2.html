Characteristics of assaults:
<ul>
<li>Sexual predators often plan sexual assaults.
<p>Sexual assault is not an accident.  Sexual predators know what they want to do, even if they have not already identified a specific target.  Most of them have a plan in mind for how they will select and control someone, or they will seek out an area where a potential victim might be isolated and unable to get help. When we say planned to some extent it may not mean days or weeks in advance but also planned in the particular moment.</p></li>
<li>Sexual predators often watch for vulnerabilities and opportunities.
<p>Sexual predators look for cues to indicate they can dominate and control a potential victim. They look for signs indicating that someone would be unlikely or unable to resist.  For instance, people who are unaware of their surroundings, alone or lost; someone who is intoxicated or in some way incapacitated.</p></li>
<li>Sexual predators often test the boundaries of potential victims.
<p>Testing boundaries may involve inappropriate comments, unwanted touching or invading personal space. It is a way of measuring the amount of resistance a potential victim might offer. A person who offers little or no resistance to these advances might be seen as a suitable target.</p></li>
