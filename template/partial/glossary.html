          <p>Unlawful or forcible entry of a residence. This incident type usually, but not always, involves theft. The illegal entry may be forcible, such as breaking a window or slashing a screen, or may be without force by entering through an unlocked door or an open window. As long as the person entering has no legal right to be present in the residence, a burglary has occurred. Also includes illegal entry of a hotel room.</p>
          <p><b>What is a burglary?</b></p>
          <p>A burglary occurs anytime there is unlawful or unauthorized entry or attempted into your house, room or hotel room. Unlawful entry does not have to involve force or someone breaking in; unlawful entry occurs anytime someone who does not have permission enters your house or hotel room. Unlawful entry can occur through a window or door that is not locked or through a window or door that has been left open.</p>
