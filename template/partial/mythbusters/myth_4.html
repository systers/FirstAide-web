ASSUMPTION: I was breaking a policy when the sexual assault occurred; therefore, staff will send me back to the U.S. ASAP.

FACT: Peace Corps honors an Immunity Policy, which is a way for Peace Corps to promote reporting of sexual assault and ensure a compassionate and supportive response by the Agency. Victims—and witnesses who didn’t help commit the sexual assault—need not fear any administrative consequences for reporting a sexual assault regardless of the circumstances or whether they were violating a Peace Corps policy when the incident occurred.  The Immunity Policy does not grant immunity for any criminal or civil liability for violations of law.
