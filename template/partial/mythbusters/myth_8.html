ASSUMPTION: I was sexually assaulted by a PCV – I don’t want to press charges in my country of service and Peace Corps can’t do anything about what happened, so I might as well not report.

FACT: This is untrue. Volunteers can pursue an internal Peace Corps administrative process through the Volunteer/Trainee Sexual Misconduct Policy. Initiating this process asks Peace Corps to address instances of sexual misconduct by other Volunteers separate from any criminal investigation or proceeding. The process allows Volunteers the opportunity to present a case for sexual misconduct before a hearing panel of Peace Corps officials who will assess the case and determine whether disciplinary action is necessary to penalize the offender.
