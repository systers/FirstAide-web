ASSUMPTION: The process of reporting is difficult and time consuming.

FACT: You will not be alone in this. If you are interested in reporting to the police, we have specially trained staff that will explain the process involved in filing a police report and how the investigation and prosecution will be conducted. Peace Corps can also hire an attorney to assist you with your legal options. Peace Corps will be with you every step of the way. Sometimes, the investigative and judicial process take a long time and will most likely be very different from the systems and procedures you may be familiar with in the United States. But even if you leave the country, Peace Corps will continue to work with the police and prosecutors and will keep you informed about your case.
