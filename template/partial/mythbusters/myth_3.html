FACT: Peace Corps goes to great lengths to train staff in the field to understand sexual assault and respond to the needs of Volunteers who become the victims of violent crime. Designated Staff at post, which include Safety and Security Managers, Peace Corps Medical Officers, and Sexual Assault Response Liaisons, are specially trained to respond to reports of sexual assault with compassion and professionalism.
