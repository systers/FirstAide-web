	<li>We will treat you with dignity and respect. No one deserves to be the victim of a sexual assault. Peace Corps will believe you if you report a rape or other sexual assault. No one at Peace Corps will blame you or think the assault was your fault.</li>
	<li>We will take appropriate steps to provide for your ongoing safety. Every effort will be made to keep you at your site as long as it is safe for you to continue service. BUT – your safety must always come first.</li>
	<li>We will provide you with the support you need to aid in your recovery. This means that Peace Corps will provide both medical care and emotional support following the event. Each case is handled based on the needs of the Volunteer and we do not automatically medevac or separate sexual assault victims from service. Although we may recommend medevac so that you can get the medical and psychological help you need, the decision to medevac is jointly determined by the Volunteer, the PCMO and the Counseling and Outreach Unit in Washington.</li>
	<li>We will help you to understand the relevant legal processes and your legal options. Peace Corps understands there may be significant cultural, language and legal challenges and as a result will help you navigate the local system. If you are interested in reporting to the police, we will stand beside you at every step of the process. The decision to report to the police is yours and yours alone – we will respect whatever decision you make.</li>
	<li>We will keep you informed of the progress of your case, should you choose to pursue prosecution. Peace Corps will ensure that you receive timely updates regarding your case whether or not you continue your service. A Victim Advocate will be available to answer any questions or concerns you have regarding the status of your case.
	<li>We will work closely with you to make decisions regarding your continued service. No decisions about your site and service will be made without your input and collaboration.</li>
	<li>We will respect your privacy and will not, without your consent, disclose your identity or share the details of the incident with anyone who does not have a legitimate need to know. Only those people who will be directly involved in your medical, emotional and security support will know your identity.
	<li>The Peace Corps Director has made it clear that all staff are expected to uphold these commitments, both in actions and words.  If you are sexually assaulted and you feel that Peace Corps staff members are not living up to the agency’s commitment, you can:
	<li>Contact the agency’s Office of Victim Advocacy, which is independent from staff at post.
	<li>Contact the Office of the Inspector General, or OIG, which provides independent oversight of agency programs and operations through regular audits, evaluations and investigations. </li>
	<li>If you feel that a sexual assault was not handled according to the agency’s Commitment to Sexual Assault Victims you can confidentially report to the OIG via an online web form located on Peace Corps’ website, or by phone, or email.
