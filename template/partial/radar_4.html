<p class="fs17">Step 3: Decide what’s best for you</p>
<p class="fs17">After figuring out what options you have, run the different scenarios in your head – say ‘What if’ – and decide which option is the best. You could try to defuse the situation by remaining calm and use good communication skills to keep the situation from escalating.  Maybe try an escape option where you run towards safety, not just away from danger.  As a last resort, try a verbal, psychological, or physical defense tactic.</p>

<p class="fs17">Sometimes your best option might be a bit unconventional. If it’s the best option to keep you safe, then it’s a good option.</p>
